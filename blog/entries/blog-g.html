       I truly and honestly have nothing to talk about this. Involving my personal life nor this class. I haven't even figured out which exercise I want to do. So I'm very sorry for not even being able to make this blog entry more than a few sentences long but when your life is as dull as all get out, what else do you expect? Hopefully, something more notable will happen in the next week that I can put into my blog.
