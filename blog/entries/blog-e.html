    <h1> 2/21/20</h1>
    <p>
        I'm not gonna lie, I am extremely drained from not only these past 24-48 hours but this week in general so I will probably make this as brief as I possibly can. Cried from frustration multiple times and not just from this project that I had to be handheld through just to even start it. Accidentally missed class (which I'm thanking whoever the majority of Thursday was studio) which means I have to find time to watch the javascript and try to figure out what else I can do with this project on my lonesome. To suffice, my time management skills have not been fantastic. It can only go down from here considering I have to work at a job now.
