        I’ve been trying to find time to finally start coding my idea for exercise 4 but I’ve been so overworked I’ve barely had time to do non coding homework. I’ll obviously have to pull myself up by my bootstraps and get something turned in, I’ve already had the dissatisfaction of accidentally missing class for my discussion presentation that I was actually looking forward to. My only hope is that my coding actually comes out how I want it to without looking like it was done in the course of an hour. I’ll probably just grab a bunch of snacks and play the “new” justice league movie in the background while I try my best.
