    <p>
I've been trying to think of which exercise to do but considering the last project and what I got on that, I truly have no idea. I've barely had the motivation to take out the trash let alone try to figure out my way around yet another coding project. I'll have to come up with at least something considering there's a checkpoint due today. It's not that I don't have time considering the two studios its just a lack of motivation and creativity. I guess besides that, it's nice to see that the weather is starting to shift which is shocking for ohio, I would have expected Winter to come back full throttle by now.
