    <h1>04.04.21</h1>
    <p>
        Its sunday again and I have nothing to write about because 1) there was no class this week and 2) because I had no class this week (minus Monday and Friday), I didn't do anything besides work. So this will probably be the shortest entry thus far. But if you're looking for a movie recommendation, I rewatched the time traveler's wife with Rachel Adams. Very strange I've seen her in 2 time travel related movies, the one mentioned above and <i>About Time</i> (also an interesting movie). Another side note worth mentioning was a homeless man denied my food offer today, strange but intriguing. I guess that's all I have to offer today.
