        I have to be honest, I remember almost nothing about this week outside of break. I fixed up the front page of my demo and I'm thanking whoever that we don't have to make the entire website match our theme because just this was hard enough. I'd like to hopefully replicate it in the future but for now, I won't even bother. At first the icons were offcenter but then I remembered that I didnt need all of them so I adjusted it and it looks way better now so the only thing I'll have to do now is replicate it on the actual front page before Tuesday. I would talk about break but I literally just watched 6teen and fell asleep the whole two days. At least none of my teachers tried to sneak past and give us work by making it due before or after the two days so I actually didnt do anything.
