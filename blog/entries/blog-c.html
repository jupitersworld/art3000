    <p>Welcome back with another episode of "I try not to overshare because my professors read this" the hit series topping the charts. Thinking about my concept for our first project and I'm not confident in my current set up. I like it but I'm also considering the workload of doing it smoothly. And then I have other ideas of the same idea but in a different variation buzzing in my mind. I considered the desktop set up as it would probably save on the need for dormant icons and then I thought about a phone instead but I'm not sure. I'm a little confused why my draft turned out so pixelated but I guess since it's a draft it doesn't need to be perfect. I've been trying to find the motivation to normal person things like showering or getting out of bed but I don't think I'm quite succeeding besides attending my classes and getting homework in on time. Overall, mundane week. And that's all for "I try not to overshare because my professors read this." Tune back in, next week! Oh, and don't click the <a href="../img/vision.jpeg">link</a>. </p>
