       I seem to be running out of less things to talk about as the weeks keep going. I'm not sure what to do for this final project exactly. I feel like I've run out of all of my even semi good ideas with all the others. Which is hard because this is supposerd to be a representatiob of everything I learned over the semester. I can only hope I figure something out by midnight.
